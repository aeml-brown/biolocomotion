# biolocomotion

The app is not yet deployed with the matlab app feature so do this:
1. make a directory where your 'MATLAB/Add-Ons/Apps' is. It should be in your user Dir.
2. name that dorectory 'biolocomotionToolbox'
3. download this project and then copy all its contents to the dir you just created
4. the first files under that directory should be '/other' and '/src'.. etc.
5. make sure that this directory (and subs) is in the MATLAB Path. (do this in matlab)
