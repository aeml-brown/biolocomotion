GENERAL
  - I should add version numbers to all files and functions
  - make matlab help func --version tell me the version too
  - story in study the SHA identifier of the version used or commit
    user can know that functions did what for papaers
  - include a citation an author stuff on main screen please cite me
  - app should use standard error calling, just like util functions do
  - make gui template better now
  - make sure that format number for decimals is not ruining me
  - make other guis also save important variables to workspace
  - clases inherit static fun of main vars so biollink.lEE exist,
    Direct that with lTAG
  - Still not sure if clases should be handle, they will pass to other
    classes and functions and create many copyes of that object?
    if a copy of the object gets saved are they still linked?
  - add JSON files to add help commands on functions
  - make sure i can save an app version in the workign dir, amke a doc dir
    or something so that user knows which app version to use.
  - saved objects need to ocntain app version used to compute them in
    vars to save
  - how can i manage autocomplete of objects that save, CTAGS?
    i need to make sure they are accesible on . command otherwise it feels
    that they are hardcoded
  - right now i have no way to really deal with diff version numbers
    nor am I checking them as i load objects with app names etc

------------------------------------------------------------------
polynomial fit
  - I should make an extarnal function that does the fit
  - in it there should be the explanation of the function adn limitataion
  - ther should be a button in ui that calls the help of that func
  - data conversion values are hardcoded m cm, etc

------------------------------------------------------------------
CAMERA OBJECT
  - should save also app vars because user need to retrieve version number

------------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN VARS
  - error functions should be static, that object is utils, no instance
  of main vars will be ever created
  - make error function display a little more pretty

------------------------------------------------------------------
MOTION MAP STANDARD
  - can add a table custom varaible that identifies the unit of measurment of each table

------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE NODE STANDARD
  - plot graph obejects hould be on utils not really in the app.
