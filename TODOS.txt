------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL
  - I should add version numbers to all files and functions
  - make matlab help func --version tell me the version too
  - story in study the SHA identifier of the version used or commit
    user can know that functions did what for papaers
  - include a citation an author stuff on main screen please cite me
  - app should use standard error calling, just like util functions do
  - make gui template better now
  - make sure that format number for decimals is not ruining me
  - make other guis also save important variables to workspace
  - clases inherit static fun of main vars so biollink.lEE exist,
    Direct that with lTAG
  - Still not sure if clases should be handle, they will pass to other
    classes and functions and create many copyes of that object?
    if a copy of the object gets saved are they still linked?

------------------------------------------------------------------
polynomial fit
  - I should make an extarnal function that does the fit
  - in it there should be the explanation of the function adn limitataion
  - ther should be a button in ui that calls the help of that func
  - data conversion values are hardcoded m cm, etc


------------------------------------------------------------------
CAMERA OBJECT
  - should save also app vars because user need to retrieve version number



------------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN VARS
  - error functions should be static, that object is utils, no instance
  of main vars will be ever created
  - make error function display a little more pretty



------------------------------------------------------------------
MOTION MAP STANDARD
  - can add a table custom varaible that identifies the unit of measurment of each table
